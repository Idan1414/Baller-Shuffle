An application that makes fair random teams for playing basketball and football "in the neighborhood".

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. (you will need to write the "npm install" command in the repo,client and server folders in order to get the node modules.
The local testing might not go so well because of the ongoing changes I am doing. (Implementing the DB connections for example).


Here are some pictures of the App :
