An application that makes fair random teams for playing basketball and football "in the neighborhood".

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The local testing might not go so well because of the ongoing changes I am doing. (Implementing the DB connections for example).


Here are some pictures of the App :
