An application that makes fair random teams for playing basketball and football "in the neighborhood".

Note:
The code in this project originates from my earlier web implementation. Since then, I’ve transitioned the project to a mobile app, which is set to be published on both Apple’s App Store and Google Play soon.

The React Native code for the mobile app is private. However, if you’re reviewing this project from my resume, rest assured—I’d be happy to showcase the mobile app code during the interview.

Here are some pictures of the App :
